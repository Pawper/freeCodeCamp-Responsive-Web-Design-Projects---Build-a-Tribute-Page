      <span>It would be nice to conquer humanity</span>
      <span>By setting myself down in the street</span>
      <span>Shaw and Brawley</span>
      <span>Ass to asphalt</span>
      <span>And taking up my prick</span>
      <span>To show the world that</span>
      <span>Even though the valley’s fields are gone</span>
      <span>I am a male</span>
      <span>And I can yet still spill my</span>
      <span>Seed in this urban desert</span>
      <span>Devoid of nature’s signature</span>
      <span>And the people would go by</span>
      <span>Wondering what in the world...?</span>
      <span>I, laughing in their faces!</span>
      <span>Has anything ever been so right</span>
      <span>To forget for a moment</span>
      <span>That I am a citizen,</span>
      <span>Shed my costume and</span>
      <span>Spread my cheeks open</span>
      <span>to touch my asshole to this street,</span>
      <span>This rocky mockery which</span>
      <span>has stolen from nature</span>
      <span>the field I could frolic in?</span>
      <span>I could do that</span>
      <span>Just to show them</span>
      <span>Where we came from</span>
      <span>That we once lived stark naked</span>
      <span>And rubbed our cocks with</span>
      <span>reckless abandon against</span>
      <span>The grass, the trees, the rocks and each </span>
      <span>Other, male or female,</span>
      <span>And we would only grin</span>
      <span>With a moment's shyness</span>
      <span>Before taking each other where</span>
      <span>Only savages want to go.      </span>
